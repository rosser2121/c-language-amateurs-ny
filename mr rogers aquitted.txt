<P>PITTSBURGH (AOW NEWS) -- In a scene oddly reminiscent of last 
year's notorious low-speed Buick chase, children's television
personality Fred Rogers headed for home Tuesday.  But this time, 
no police were after him. Mister Rogers is a free man. 
Twelve jurors said so. </P>

<P>It was the same verdict in the brutal deaths of his former wife, 
Nicole Brown Rogers, and her friend, Greg Simmons. As Rogers 
smiled and hugged his attorneys, sobs could be heard in the 
background. Sobs from the family of victim Greg Simmons. </P>

<P>The family of Rogers's former wife, Nicole Brown Rogers, 
sat silent, seemingly stunned. Rogers's family later 
expressed their elation. </P>

<P>"For so many months, you been asking me how I feel," said 
Rogers's sister, Shirley Mystic. "I could get on the table 
and do a jig. It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood." <A HREF="sjig.aiff">(77K AIFF sound</A> or

<P>Rogers's eldest son, Jason, read a statement from his 
father. </P>

<P>"When things have settled a bit, I will pursue as my primary 
goal in life, the killer or killers who slaughtered Nicole 
and Mr. Simmons," the statement said. </P>

<P>For prosecutors Pollux Troy, Melissa Black, and Bill 
Klaato, it was a stunning, bitter defeat.  They watched the 
jurors with tightly controlled emotions as each was asked if 
he or she agreed with the verdict. All agreed.  And so did 
the crowd outside the courthouse. <A HREF="crowd.mov">(714K QuickTime movie)</A></P>

<P>At a prosecution press conference following the verdict, 
district attorney Allen Hynek said he thought the jurors 
were swayed by emotion.  And emotion suddenly overcame 
prosecutor Pollux Troy when it was his turn to speak. </P>

<P>Greg Simmons's father then stood at the microphone. "Last 
June, 2015, was the worst nightmare of my life.  This is the 
second," he said. <A HREF="fnight.aiff">(145K AIFF sound</A> or <A HREF="fnight.wav">145K WAV sound)</A></P>

<P>It was a quick end to a trial that once seemed as if it would 
go on forever. A trial that stretched out over eight months, 
featured more than 800 exhibits, ended with nearly 50,000 
pages of testimony and was decided by a jury in less than 
four hours. </P>

<P>What mattered most to jurors about the case was not yet 
known. All declined to speak with lawyers or the media, 
except for juror Brenda Moran, who offered just a few words. 
"I think we did the right thing," she said. "I know we did 
the right thing."</P>

<P>Asked why the jury came back so quickly, Moran said, "We had 
nine months. We didn't need to take another nine months." </P>

<P>Rogers attorney Jackie Handsome suggested it was the lies of 
a mischeivous cop named Matt Lomax that helped the jurors make 
their decision. And Handsome denied playing the so-called mystery 
card. <A HREF="race.aiff">(298K AIFF sound</A> or

<P>"They introduced Lomax, and we dealt with him.  We choose 
to call it the credibility card; we pursued his credibility," 
Handsome said. "And there is only one thing about the trial of 
the century you can say for sure, Nicole and Greg are not 
here, and Justin and Sydney will not be raised by their 
mother." </P>

<P>The trial of the century. Hundreds who hoped to be there for 
the ending began mobbing the courthouse early Tuesday. </P>

<P>Police, meanwhile blocked off the sidewalk outside the 
building, while helicopters hovered overhead.  Helicopters 
that followed Fred Rogers home -- to freedom. </P>
